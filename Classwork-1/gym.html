	<p>Gymming, or working out at the gym, is a popular activity for enhancing physical fitness and overall well-being. It involves a variety of exercises designed to build strength, improve cardiovascular health, and boost flexibility. Gyms typically offer an array of equipment, including free weights, resistance machines, and cardio machines like treadmills and stationary bikes. In addition to individual workouts, many gyms provide group fitness classes such as yoga, spinning, and HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training), which offer structured and motivational environments.</p>
